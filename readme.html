<h1>Emojam</h1>

<p>Emojam is a lightweight Emoji picker/keyboard for X-Windows on Unix-like systems.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>Most Linux systems with X-Windows will probably have these pre-installed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python 3</li>
<li>PyGObject (GTK 3 for Python)</li>
<li>Noto Color Emoji Font (from Noto Fonts, Google's free international unicode fonts) - https://fonts.google.com/noto</li>
<li>A Linux or Unix-like system</li>
</ul>

<p>In Debian you should be able to handle these with:</p>

<p><code>
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo fonts-noto-color-emoji
</code></p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>The easiest way to get an emoji from Emojam into another window is to drag and drop it. You can also right-click the emoji and click "Copy" to copy it to the clipboard. You can also click on it to have it print to standard output, or to add to the "Output:" field, where it can be copied to the clipboard or strung together with other emojis and characters.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>

<p>When I went looking for an emoji keyboard for Linux, the ones I found all had fatal flaws. Some required a specific package manager, or a specific desktop environment. Some only worked in certain GUI toolkit text fields. Some had hundreds of megabytes of dependencies or large bundled downloads.</p>

<p>I thought I could make something that is flexible, easy to use, and without a bunch of un-necessary dependencies. This should run out-of-the-box on many Linux systems with a GUI, in any window manager, and is just a few hundred kilobytes to download.</p>
